## Controllers

Controllers are responsible for handling HTTP requests and returning responses. They should be thin and delegate business logic to services.

### REST API Controllers

#### Best Practices:
1. **Use appropriate annotations**
   - `@RestController` for REST APIs
   - `@RequestMapping` at class level for base path
   - `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc. for specific endpoints

2. **Input validation**
   - Use `@Valid` and JSR-380 annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`, etc.) on request DTOs
   - Create custom validators for complex validations

3. **Response handling**
   - Use `ResponseEntity<T>` for full control over HTTP response
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 204, 400, 404, etc.)
   - Include meaningful error messages in error responses

4. **Exception handling**
   - Create a global exception handler with `@ControllerAdvice` or `@RestControllerAdvice`
   - Map specific exceptions to specific HTTP status codes
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages

5. **API documentation**
   - Use Swagger/OpenAPI annotations to document your API
   - Include descriptions, example values, and possible responses

6. **Security**
   - Apply proper authorization checks
   - Validate and sanitize input data
   - Protect against CSRF, XSS, and other security vulnerabilities

### View Controllers

#### Best Practices:
1. **Use appropriate annotations**
   - `@Controller` for view controllers
   - `@RequestMapping` for mapping URLs to views

2. **Model attributes**
   - Use `Model` or `ModelMap` to add attributes to the view
   - Keep view-specific logic in the controller

3. **Form handling**
   - Use `@ModelAttribute` for form binding
   - Validate form input with `@Valid`

4. **Flash attributes**
   - Use `RedirectAttributes` for flash messages after redirects

## Services

Services contain the business logic of the application. They should be independent of the web layer and focus on domain operations.

### Best Practices:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each service should have a single responsibility
   - Break down complex services into smaller, focused ones

2. **Transaction management**
   - Use `@Transactional` at the service level
   - Define appropriate propagation and isolation levels
   - Handle transaction rollbacks properly

3. **Exception handling**
   - Create and throw domain-specific exceptions
   - Don't expose persistence exceptions to the controller layer
   - Use unchecked exceptions for unrecoverable errors

4. **Validation**
   - Validate business rules at the service level
   - Don't rely solely on controller-level validation

5. **Dependency Injection**
   - Use constructor injection for required dependencies
   - Consider using `@RequiredArgsConstructor` from Lombok

6. **Logging**
   - Log important business operations and exceptions
   - Use appropriate log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR)
   - Include relevant context in log messages

7. **Mapping between entities and DTOs**
   - Use mapping libraries like MapStruct or ModelMapper
   - Keep mapping logic consistent across the application

## Repositories

Repositories provide access to the database and handle data persistence. They should focus on data access operations.

### Best Practices:
1. **Use Spring Data interfaces**
   - Extend `JpaRepository`, `CrudRepository`, or `PagingAndSortingRepository`
   - Leverage derived query methods for simple queries

2. **Custom queries**
   - Use `@Query` for complex queries
   - Use named parameters instead of positional parameters
   - Consider using native queries for performance-critical operations

3. **Pagination and sorting**
   - Accept `Pageable` parameters for paginated results
   - Return `Page<T>` or `Slice<T>` for paginated data

4. **Projections**
   - Use interface or class projections to limit returned data
   - Consider dynamic projections for flexible queries

5. **Specifications and criteria**
   - Use `JpaSpecificationExecutor` for dynamic queries
   - Build complex criteria queries for advanced filtering

6. **Auditing**
   - Use Spring Data's auditing capabilities (`@CreatedDate`, `@LastModifiedDate`, etc.)
   - Consider using `@EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)`

7. **Performance considerations**
   - Avoid N+1 query problems with proper fetch strategies
   - Use `@EntityGraph` for optimizing fetching of related entities
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed, rarely changed data

## General Principles

These principles apply to all layers of the application architecture:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each layer should have a specific responsibility
   - Avoid mixing concerns across layers

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - Use Spring's DI container to manage dependencies
   - Prefer constructor injection over field injection

3. **Immutability**
   - Use immutable objects where possible
   - Consider using Lombok's `@Value` for immutable classes

4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for each layer
   - Use mocks or test doubles for dependencies
   - Consider using Spring Boot's testing utilities

5. **Documentation**
   - Document public APIs and important implementation details
   - Use meaningful names for classes, methods, and variables

6. **Error Handling**
   - Handle errors at the appropriate level
   - Provide meaningful error messages
   - Log errors with sufficient context

7. **Security**
   - Apply security at all layers
   - Validate input at multiple levels
   - Follow the principle of least privilege

By following these best practices, you can create a maintainable, scalable, and robust Spring Boot application.
